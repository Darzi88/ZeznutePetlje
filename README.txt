A program that given two numbers finds their greatest common divisor (GCD) and their least common multiple (LCM).
Search the Internet for the Euclidean algorithm for calculation the greatest common divisor (CGD)
or read about it in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm.

LCM uses formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)

have fun :)
